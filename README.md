# üåï Moonglade

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/ediwang/Edi-GitHub/_apis/build/status/EdiWang.Moonglade?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/ediwang/Edi-GitHub/_build/latest?definitionId=68&branchName=master) ![Docker Build and Push](https://github.com/EdiWang/Moonglade/workflows/Docker%20Build%20and%20Push/badge.svg)

The [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) blog system of [edi.wang](https://edi.wang) that runs on [**Microsoft Azure**](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/). Enabling most common blogging features including Posts, Comments, Categories, Archive, Tags, Pages and Friendlink.

## üì¶ Deployment

### ‚òÅ Full Deploy on Azure (Recommend)

This is the way https://edi.wang is deployed, by taking advantage of as many Azure services as possible, the blog can run very fast and secure with only ~$300 USD/month.

It is recommended to use stable code from [Release](https://github.com/EdiWang/Moonglade/releases) rather than master branch.

This diagram shows a recommended full feature Azure deployment for Moonglade. It doesn't come out of the box. Although the `./Deployment/AzureAppServiceDeploy.ps1` can cover a part of it, you have to manually setup every other piece of it.

## üêµ Development

Tools | Alternative
--- | ---
[.NET 5.0 SDK](http://dot.net) | N/A
[Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) | [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
[SQL Server 2019](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-2019) / LocalDB | N/A

### üíæ Setup Database

Create an [SQL Server 2019 LocalDB](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/sql-server-express-localdb?view=sql-server-ver15?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5002809) database. e.g. ```moonglade```

Update the `MoongladeDatabase` with your database connection string in `appsettings.Development.json` or set environment variable: `ConnectionStrings__MoongladeDatabase` to your connection string. 

Example

```json
"MoongladeDatabase": "Server=(localdb)\\MSSQLLocalDB;Database=moonglade;Trusted_Connection=True;"
```

*For Azure App Service, you can set the connection string in the Configuration blade.*

### üî® Build Source

Build and run `./src/Moonglade.sln`
- Admin entrance: `/admin`
- Default username: `admin`
- Default password: `admin123`

## ‚öô Configuration

> This section discuss system settings in **appsettings.[env].json**. For blog settings, please use "/admin/settings" UI.

**For production, it is strongly recommended to use Environment Variables over appsetting.json file.**

### üõ° Authentication

#### [Azure Active Directory](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/active-directory/)

See [Wiki document](https://github.com/EdiWang/Moonglade/wiki/Use-Azure-Active-Directory-Authentication)

#### Local Account (Alternative)

Set `Authentication:Provider` to `"Local"`. You can manage accounts in `/admin/settings/account`

### üñº Image Storage
`AppSettings:ImageStorage` controls how blog post images are stored.

#### [Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/blobs/) (Preferred)

You need to create an [**Azure Blob Storage**](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/blobs/) with **container level permission**. 

```json
"Provider": "azurestorage"
"AzureStorageSettings": {
  "ConnectionString": "YOUR CONNECTION STRING",
  "ContainerName": "YOUR CONTAINER NAME"
}
```

When configured the image storage to use Azure Blob, you can take advantage of CDN for your image resources. Set ```GetImageByCDNRedirect``` to ```true```, the blog will get images from client browser using a 302 redirect. 

```json
"CDNSettings": {
    "EnableCDNRedirect": true,
    "CDNEndpoint": "https://yourendpoint.azureedge.net/moonglade-images"
}
```

#### File System (Not Recommended)

You can also choose File System for image storage, but this will make your site root not read-only, which would be a potential security issue. And it will be harder for you to backup or update the website.

```json
"Provider": "filesystem",
"FileSystemSettings": {
  "Path": "${basedir}\\UploadedImages"
}
```
The ```Path``` can be relative or absolute. ```"$\{basedir\}"``` represents the website's current directory. 

#### [Minio Blob Storage](https://min.io/) (Free)

You need to hava an [**Minio Server**](https://docs.min.io/). 

```json
"Provider": "miniostorage"
"MinioStorageSettings": {
  "EndPoint": "Minio Server Endpoint(eg:localhost:9600)",
  "AccessKey": "Your Access Key",
  "SecretKey": "Your Secret Key",
  "BucketName": "Your BucketName",
  "WithSSL": false
}
```

### üìß Email Notification

If you need email notification for new comments, new replies and pingbacks, you have to setup the [Moonglade.Notification Azure Function](https://github.com/EdiWang/Moonglade.Notification) first, and then set the values in ```appsettings.[env].json``` or in your runtime environment variables.

```json
"Notification": {
  "Enabled": true,
  "AzureFunctionEndpoint": "{PROD-ENV-VARIABLE}"
}
```
